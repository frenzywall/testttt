as part of your feature suggestion you recommended we implement a calendar view, i think thats a great idea. can you implement a modern, feature rich calendar view that matches the theme and ui langauage of our ui, create seperate files for the js and css files and import them , do your magic claude

integrate it seamlessly within the ui like we did with compare and edit,

what im thinking is that the view calendar when opened, should replace the columns from affectted services to end date, and when i hover the date of that service in calnder view it should highlight that row, do your magic
